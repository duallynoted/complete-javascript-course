/**
 Everything is an Object: Prototype and Inheritance Chain
 **/

//everything is an object, but not really
//there are two big types of values: primitives and objects
//primitives are these data types: numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, and null
//objects are: everything else!
//--arrays, functions, objects, dates, wrappers for Numbers, Strings, and Booleans, etc

//object-oriented programming:
//--objects interacting with one another through methods and properties
//--used to store data, structure applications into modules, and keep code clean
//a constructor (or prototype) is like a blueprint to make other objects
//inheritance is when one object is based on another object
//--when one object gets access to another object's methods and properties
